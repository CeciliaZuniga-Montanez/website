Hi, I am Cecilia. I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research (NIESR) working on the [ICICLES project](https://www.iciclesproject.com/) which explores the impact of the pandemic on children's language, educational and socioemotional skills. I am also a Research Assistant at the University of Leeds, UK. Prior to this, I worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Leeds with Dr Cat Davies on the impact phase of the project Children Learning Adjectives. My areas of interest include infant and child language and cognitive development, language delays and vocabulary interventions.
