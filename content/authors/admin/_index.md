I am a Research Associate at the University of Sheffield, UK. I am currently working on the [ICICLES project](https://www.iciclesproject.com/): a three-year longitudinal project exploring the impact of the pandemic on children's language, educational and socioemotional skills (previously based at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research). I have worked on various projects investigating typical and atypical language development in childhood at the University of Leeds and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. My areas of interest include infant and child language and cognitive development, language delays and vocabulary interventions.
