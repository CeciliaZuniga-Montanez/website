I am a Research Associate at the University of Oxford, UK. I have previously worked on various projects investigating typical and atypical language development in childhood at the University of Sheffield, University of Leeds and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research. My areas of interest include infant and child language and cognitive development, language delays and vocabulary interventions.
