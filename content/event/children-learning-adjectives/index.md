The role of vocabulary breadth and depth in children’s achievement at school and beyond is well recognised. One way of enriching vocabulary is through a rich system of descriptive language. Classroom and clinical practice is designed to support this, and research findings further highlight the power of adjectives and other kinds of descriptive language in children’s developing language systems.

Despite their importance in communication, adjectives have received relatively little attention in research, and up to now there has been limited exchange between teachers, clinicians, and researchers. To remedy this, this workshop brings together academic, educational, and clinical perspectives on how children develop descriptive language.
