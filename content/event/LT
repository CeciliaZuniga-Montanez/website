We are pleased to announce our online two half-day workshop on “Late talkers: Interdisciplinary approaches to understand early language delay”, hosted by the University of Warwick, on the 23rd and 24th of August 2021, from 13:45 pm - 17:30 pm BST.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers from different disciplines interested in language development in late talkers. The workshop offers an opportunity to learn about the recent approaches used from different fields to understand the underlying mechanism influencing early language delay. Some examples are works conducted in the area of network science and computational science.
