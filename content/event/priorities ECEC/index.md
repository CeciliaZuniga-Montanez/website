This exploratory, interdisciplinary workshop brings together a small and diverse group of academic researchers and practitioners in ECEC and child development to identify intersecting research priorities. Through network-building and project scoping, we will determine how we can make the most effective evidence-based recommendations for policy and practice, and support the sector in meeting the evolving needs of young children and their families within our changing social, political, and economic context.

The workshop will include talks and discussions from multiple perspectives and areas of expertise. Workshop invitees and speakers will span job types and career stages from research and practice. Please note that this workshop is by-invite only. 

Local organisers: [Prof Catherine Davies](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/languages/staff/699/professor-catherine-davies) and [Dr Cecilia Zuniga-Montanez](https://ahc.leeds.ac.uk/languages/staff/3301/dr-cecilia-zuniga-montanez).
