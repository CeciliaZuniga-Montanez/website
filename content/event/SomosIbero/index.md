We are living in an unprecedented historical moment, in which access to truthful and valuable information is essential to understand the current situation that surrounds us. That is why we have joined forces with alumni and staff members from the *Universidad Iberoamericana* (Mexico City, Mexico) to share with you a modern and committed vision of the world.

The first international congress of the alumni network #SomosIbero will have more than 80 speakers and will have three thematic lines. The first one dedicated to the talent of graduates who live abroad and who make up the Alumni Network #SomosIbero in the World; the second one will focus on a vision towards the future and, in the third, graduates of different academic programs and generations that have excelled in their professions will share their success stories with the audience. 

See below for the full program (in Spanish).
Please note that all talks will be in Spanish.
